## Project Structure

- _PhyMaBiCh has a modular approach on the project structure, having the projrct application divided into three; documentation, frontend and the backend._

```sh
PhyMaBiCh/
 ├─ backend/
 ├─ docs/
 ├─ /frontend
 ├─ README.md
```

### Documentation

- _This section provides comprehensive guidance on the project, including an overview of its purpose, detailed usage instructions, and clear contribution guidelines to facilitate collaboration and community engagement._

### Backend

- _The backend is a robust Python-based application server, architected with FastAPI to deliver high-performance, asynchronous request handling. It seamlessly integrates with the OpenAI API to power advanced AI-driven functionalities and deliver a sophisticated user experience._

### Frontend

- _The frontend leverages the Vue.js framework, offering a scalable and maintainable architecture that effectively manages the application's complexity while ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface._

## Tech Stack

- _PhyMaBiCh application leverages the cobined work of Python API servers backend and Vue framework frontend to render the application AI._
